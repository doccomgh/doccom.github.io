      <h1>What we do</h1>
      <p class="lead">Doc-Com is a free to download instant messaging app run by Mobidoc Ghana Limited. It is designed for professionals of various categories such as those in Medicine to keep in touch with their clients outside the formal office setting.</p>
      <p>Medical practitioners are usually burdened with long queues, and their clients do not get adequate satisfaction from the formal office visits. Doc- com provides a platform for an extension of this formal encounter. 

Doc-Com is expected to excite the professional community starting with Medical practitioners. These categories of professionals have had to look bad for so long for refusing to freely offer their “personal” contact information to their cherished clients. In the area of health, medical professionals say they are aware of the advantages of being able to easily seek clarification from your healthcare giver. 

To use this app, both the professionals and clients are required to download the Doc-Com app and create either a “professional” or “client” account depending on whether they are seeking a service through the app or are offering the service. All information on the registration form is mandatory as it is required to maintain the service running. During the usual office meeting, a client who may be interested in further communication with a professional for feedback purposes, clarifications or to give additional information may request for the professional’s username. After acquiring a “client account”, the client logs into the Doc-Com app, searches for the username (of the professional he/she may be interested in) received from the previous meeting and follows the prompt on his mobile screen. A request is made for a small charge in order to access the professional’s account. It should be noted that part of this will be used to encourage more professionals to join the platform and some used to improve the service.
There are many obvious advantages for both clients and professionals who use the app. Now, professionals can be sure they won’t be receiving unnecessary messages from their clients and will not hesitate to help them with their genuine needs. Communications have been limited to texting and sharing of media files intentionally to prevent the service from interfering with a professional’s daily activities. Communications have been bundled as sessions. One session may last from a few minutes to hours or to a few days depending on the kind of help a client requires of a professional. Professionals after satisfying their clients may end a session successfully and conversations removed automatically.
